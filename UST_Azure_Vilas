		Avoids "Noisy Neighbor" Effect: Dedicated resources eliminate the risk of performance being impacted by the activities of other tenants, as can sometimes occur in a public cloud.
		Challenges of Private Cloud:

		Higher Initial Investment: Building an on-premises private cloud requires significant upfront capital expenditure on hardware, software licenses, and implementation costs.
		Ongoing Management and Maintenance: The organization is responsible for the ongoing management, maintenance, patching, and upgrades of the private cloud infrastructure, which can require specialized IT staff.
		Limited Scalability Compared to Public Cloud: While private clouds offer scalability within their dedicated resources, they might not have the same virtually limitless scalability as public clouds. Scaling often requires additional hardware investment and lead times.
		Lower Resource Utilization Potential: If resources are not efficiently utilized, a private cloud might lead to lower overall resource utilization compared to the shared infrastructure of a public cloud.
		Responsibility for Security: While offering more control, the organization is also fully responsible for implementing and maintaining the security of its private cloud environment.
		Potential for Underutilized Capacity: If the organization over-provisions for peak demands, a significant portion of the infrastructure might remain underutilized during normal operations.
		Common Use Cases for Private Cloud:

		Organizations with Strict Security and Compliance Requirements: Industries like finance, healthcare, and government often choose private clouds to meet stringent regulatory obligations.
		Organizations with Specific Performance or Latency Requirements: Applications that demand low latency or consistent high performance might be better suited for a private cloud environment.

Each region is independent, allowing for fault isolation and localized services. Examples include West US 2, East US, West Europe, Southeast Asia, and Central India (Bengaluru).

	Availability Zones (AZs): 
		Within most Azure Regions, there are Availability Zones. These are physically separate data centers within a region, each with independent power, cooling, and networking. They are connected by a high-speed, low-latency network (typically with a latency of less than 2 milliseconds). Availability Zones provide high availability and fault tolerance to applications and data. If one zone experiences a failure, the others remain operational. A region typically has 2-3 Availability Zones.

	Data Centers: 
		These are the physical buildings that house the servers, storage, networking equipment, and power and cooling infrastructure that run Azure services. Microsoft doesn't publicly disclose the exact locations of all its data centers for security reasons, but they are distributed across the Azure Regions and Availability Zones.

	Region Pairs: 
		For business continuity and disaster recovery (BCDR), most Azure Regions are paired with another region within the same geography, typically over 300 miles away. This pairing allows for coordinated updates and replication of resources across regions to minimize downtime during planned outages or in the event of a disaster.

	Azure Global Network: 
		This encompasses the physical and software-defined networking infrastructure that connects the Azure data centers worldwide. It includes a vast network of fiber optic cables, routers, and edge locations (Points of Presence - PoPs) to ensure high bandwidth, low latency, and reliable connectivity between Azure services and end-users. The Azure Edge Network, including services like Azure CDN and Azure Front Door, extends this reach closer to users for improved performance.

Key Characteristics and Benefits:

	Global Reach: 
		Azure's extensive global footprint allows organizations to deploy applications and data closer to their users, reducing latency and improving performance.
	High Availability and Resiliency: 
		Availability Zones and Region Pairs provide multiple layers of redundancy to protect against hardware failures, power outages, and even natural disasters, ensuring business continuity.
	Scalability and Flexibility: 
		The massive infrastructure allows for easy scaling of resources up or down based on demand.
	Compliance and Data Residency: 
		Azure's numerous regions and geographies help organizations meet local data residency and compliance requirements.
	Security: 
		Microsoft invests heavily in the physical and logical security of its data centers.
	Sustainability: 
		Microsoft is committed to sustainability and is continuously innovating to reduce the environmental impact of its data centers.

Regions, Availability Zones, and Data Centers
----------------------------------------------------------------


Cloud regions are geographical locations where cloud providers establish data centers to host their services. These regions are designed to be independent and isolated from each other to ensure fault tolerance and high availability.

Key aspects of cloud regions:

Geographic Location: Regions are situated in specific geographic areas worldwide, such as North America, Europe, Asia Pacific, etc.
Multiple Data Centers: Each region typically comprises multiple data centers, often referred to as Availability Zones (AZs) or simply zones.
Isolation: Regions are designed to be isolated to prevent failures in one region from affecting others. This isolation helps in disaster recovery and ensures business continuity.
Low Latency: Choosing a region closer to the users can reduce latency and improve application performance.
Compliance: Regions help organizations meet data sovereignty and compliance requirements by allowing them to host data within specific geographic boundaries.
Benefits of Cloud Regions:

Improved Performance: Selecting a region closer to the user base minimizes latency, resulting in faster application response times and a better user experience.
High Availability and Disaster Recovery: Distributing resources across multiple regions provides redundancy and enables failover mechanisms in case of regional outages.
Scalability: Regions offer the ability to scale resources globally, allowing businesses to expand their reach and handle increased demand in different geographic locations.
Data Sovereignty and Compliance: Regions enable organizations to comply with local data storage and privacy regulations by choosing regions within specific jurisdictions.
Cost Optimization: Different regions may have varying pricing models, allowing organizations to select cost-effective regions for their specific workloads.
Cloud Region Availability Zones:

Availability Zones (AZs) are distinct data centers within a cloud region. They are designed to be isolated from each other to provide fault tolerance within the same region.

Key characteristics of Availability Zones:

Isolation: AZs are physically separated within a region, with independent power, cooling, and networking infrastructure.
Redundancy: Distributing resources across multiple AZs within a region ensures high availability. If one AZ fails, resources in other AZs can continue to operate.
Low Latency Connectivity: AZs within the same region are interconnected by high-bandwidth, low-latency networks, enabling fast data transfer and synchronization.
Fault Domains: AZs act as fault domains, meaning that failures within one AZ are unlikely to impact other AZs in the same region.



A data center is a dedicated facility that houses computer systems and associated components, such as telecommunications and storage systems. It typically includes redundant or backup power supplies, redundant data communications connections, environmental controls (e.g., air conditioning, fire suppression), and security devices.

In the context of cloud computing, data centers are the physical locations where cloud providers build and operate the infrastructure that powers their services. These facilities are designed to be highly secure, reliable, and scalable to meet the demands of a large number of users and applications.

Key characteristics of cloud data centers:

Massive Scale: Cloud providers operate very large data centers, often containing hundreds of thousands of servers and storage devices.
Redundancy: Everything in a cloud data center is typically redundant, from power and cooling to network connectivity, to ensure high availability.
Security: They implement stringent physical and logical security measures to protect the hosted data and infrastructure.
Efficiency: Cloud data centers are designed for energy efficiency to reduce operational costs and environmental impact.
Connectivity: They have high-bandwidth and low-latency network connections to ensure fast and reliable access to cloud services.
Availability Zones (AZs)
Availability Zones (AZs) are physically separate and isolated data centers within a single cloud region. Each AZ is designed to be independent of other AZs in the same region, with its own power, cooling, and networking infrastructure.

Key characteristics of Availability Zones:

Isolation: AZs are designed to prevent failures in one zone from impacting other zones within the same region. This isolation extends to power grids, cooling systems, and network connectivity.
Redundancy within a Region: By deploying applications and data across multiple AZs within a region, users can achieve high availability and fault tolerance. If one AZ experiences an outage, the application can continue running in other AZs.
Low Latency Connectivity: AZs within the same region are interconnected by high-bandwidth, low-latency networks. This allows for fast and synchronous replication of data between zones, which is crucial for many highly available applications.
Fault Domains: AZs represent distinct fault domains. This means that a common failure affecting one AZ (e.g., a power outage in that specific location) should not impact other AZs.
Relationship between Regions and Availability Zones:

A Region is a geographical area where a cloud provider has a presence and hosts multiple AZs.
Each Availability Zone is one or more discrete data centers within that region.
Regions are designed to be isolated from each other, while AZs within a region are interconnected.
Benefits of using Availability Zones:

High Availability: Distributing resources across multiple AZs protects applications from single points of failure.
Fault Tolerance: If one AZ fails, resources in other AZs remain available.
Disaster Recovery: AZs can be used as part of a disaster recovery strategy within the same geographic region.
Improved Performance: Low-latency connections between AZs enable efficient data replication and synchronization for performance-sensitive applications.

Resource Groups & Resource Manager
----------------------------------------------------------------


Azure Resource Groups

	Logical Containers: 
		Resource Groups are fundamental building blocks in Azure, acting as logical containers for related Azure resources. These resources could be virtual machines, storage accounts, databases, web apps, network interfaces, etc.
	Management Unit: 
		They allow you to manage these related resources as a single entity. This means you can perform actions like deploying, managing, monitoring, and deleting all the resources within a group simultaneously.
	Lifecycle Management: 
		Resources that share a similar lifecycle (e.g., all components of a specific application) are typically grouped together. This simplifies management as you can apply policies, access control, and billing tracking at the group level.
	Metadata Storage: 
		Resource Groups store metadata about the resources within them. The location you specify for the resource group determines where this metadata is stored. Note that the resources within the group can reside in different Azure regions.
	No Nesting: 
		Resource groups cannot be nested within other resource groups.
	Global Uniqueness (within a subscription): 
		Resource group names must be unique within your Azure subscription.


	Benefits of using Resource Groups:

		Simplified Management: 
			Perform actions on multiple resources at once, reducing administrative overhead.
		Logical Organization: 
			Group resources based on application, environment (dev, test, prod), department, or any other logical structure that suits your organization.
		Cost Management: 
			Track costs associated with a specific project or application by grouping its resources in a dedicated resource group.
		Access Control (RBAC): 
			Apply Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) at the resource group level to manage who has permissions to the resources within it. This simplifies permission management for related resources.
		Deployment and Deletion: 
			Deploy and delete entire application stacks or environments as a single unit.
		Policy Enforcement: 
			Apply Azure Policies at the resource group level to enforce compliance and configuration standards across all contained resources.
		Tagging: 
			Apply tags to resource groups to categorize and organize resources for billing, monitoring, and automation purposes. Tags applied to a resource group are not automatically inherited by the resources within it.
	How to manage Resource Groups:

		Azure Portal: 
			Provides a graphical interface for creating, viewing, managing, and deleting resource groups.
		Azure CLI: 
			Use command-line interface commands (e.g., az group create, az group list, az group delete) to manage resource groups.
		Azure PowerShell: 
			Utilize PowerShell cmdlets (e.g., New-AzResourceGroup, Get-AzResourceGroup, Remove-AzResourceGroup) for programmatic management.
		ARM Templates (Azure Resource Manager Templates) & Bicep: 
			Define the infrastructure, including resource groups and the resources within them, in a declarative JSON (ARM) or more concise (Bicep) format for automated and repeatable deployments.
		Azure SDKs: 
			Use various SDKs (e.g., .NET, Python, Java) to manage resource groups programmatically.
Azure Resource Manager (ARM)


	Deployment and Management Service: 
		Azure Resource Manager (ARM) is the underlying deployment and management service for Azure. It acts as the control plane for all Azure resources.
	Unified Interface: 
		It provides a consistent management layer that enables you to create, update, and delete resources in your Azure account through various tools like the Azure Portal, Azure CLI, Azure PowerShell, and REST APIs. Regardless of the tool you use, all requests go through the ARM API.
	Declarative Model: 
		ARM allows you to define your infrastructure as code using ARM templates or Bicep files. These templates describe the desired state of your infrastructure, and ARM takes care of provisioning and configuring the resources accordingly. This is known as Infrastructure as Code (IaC).
	Consistent State Management: 
		ARM ensures that your resources are deployed in a consistent state. If a deployment of multiple resources fails, ARM can automatically roll back the changes, preventing partially configured environments.
	Integration with Azure AD: 
		ARM integrates with Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) for authentication and authorization, enabling you to manage access control and enforce policies consistently across your Azure resources.
	Key Capabilities of Azure Resource Manager:

		Template-Driven Deployment: 
			Deploy complex infrastructures consistently and repeatedly using ARM templates or Bicep files.
		Resource Grouping: 
			Enforces the organization of resources into Resource Groups for logical management.
		Role-Based Access Control (RBAC): 
			Provides granular control over who can perform actions on Azure resources at different scopes (management groups, subscriptions, resource groups, and individual resources).
		Tagging: 
			Allows you to apply metadata (tags) to resources for organization, billing, and management.
		Resource Locking: 
			Enables you to lock resources or resource groups to prevent accidental deletion or modification.
		Deployment Sequencing: 
			Allows you to define the order in which resources are deployed and configure dependencies between them.
		Parameterization: 
			ARM templates and Bicep files support parameters, allowing you to customize deployments for different environments.
		Variables: 
			Define reusable values within your templates for consistency.
		Extensibility: 
			Extension resources can be added to other resources to enhance their capabilities (e.g., VM extensions).
		Auditing: 
			ARM logs all user actions, providing an audit trail for compliance and security purposes.


----------------------------------------------------------------
Understanding Subscriptions & Billing"
----------------------------------------------------------------



I. Azure Subscriptions

A. What is an Azure Subscription?

	Logical Container: 
		An Azure subscription is a fundamental logical unit that provides you with access to Azure services. Think of it as a container that holds your Azure resources (virtual machines, storage accounts, databases, etc.).
	Billing Boundary: 
		It serves as a primary billing boundary. All the resources you deploy within a specific subscription are billed together under that subscription.
	Security and Policy Boundary: 
		Subscriptions also act as a security and policy boundary. You can manage access control (RBAC) and enforce Azure Policies at the subscription level, applying them to all resources within it.
	Association with an Azure Account: 
		An Azure subscription is linked to an Azure account, which is the identity you use to sign in (Microsoft 
		Account or Work/School account).
		e.g. vilasvarghese@outlook.com
		
	Association with an Azure Tenant (Azure AD Tenant / Azure Entra ID Tenant): 
		Subscriptions are associated with an Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) tenant (now known as Microsoft Entra ID tenant). This tenant represents your organization in Azure and manages identities.
		e.g. primary entra id 
B. Why are Azure Subscriptions Necessary?

	Billing Organization: 
		Allows you to separate billing for different projects, departments, or environments, making cost tracking and allocation easier.
	Access Control Management: 
		Enables you to manage permissions to groups of related resources efficiently using Azure Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) at the subscription level.

Azure Automation is a cloud-based automation and configuration service that allows you to automate manual, long-running, error-prone, and frequently repeated tasks. It helps you manage your Azure and non-Azure environments efficiently, reducing operational overhead and increasing consistency. Think of it as your cloud-native scripting and orchestration engine.

Here's a breakdown of key concepts and benefits of Azure Automation:

Core Concepts:

	Runbooks: 
		These are the heart of Azure Automation. 
		Scripts written in 
			PowerShell Workflow, 
			Python 3, or 
			graphical formats 
				define the automation tasks you want to perform.
	PowerShell Workflow Runbooks: 
		Leverage the power of PowerShell 
			+ workflow capabilities for long-running operations and 
			checkpointing.
	Python 3 Runbooks: 
		Utilize the flexibility and extensive libraries of Python for automation tasks.
	Graphical Runbooks: 
		Provide a visual, 
			drag-and-drop interface for building 
				automation workflows, 
				making it accessible to users with less scripting experience.
	Graphical PowerShell Workflow Runbooks: 
		A visual way to create PowerShell Workflow runbooks.
	Automation Account: 
		This is your container in Azure where all your automation resources (runbooks, modules, schedules, variables, credentials, etc.) are stored and managed. You need at least one Automation Account to start using the service.
	Modules: 
		These are packages of pre-written cmdlets or Python libraries that you can import and use in your runbooks. Azure Automation provides a gallery of built-in modules and allows you to import custom modules or those from the PowerShell Gallery and PyPI.
	Schedules: 
		You can link your runbooks to schedules to run them automatically at predefined times or recurring intervals.
	Variables: 
		These are named values that can be used across your runbooks and configurations. They are useful for storing configuration settings, connection strings, or other dynamic data. You can manage them through the Azure portal or programmatically.
	Credentials: 
		Azure Automation provides a secure way to store and manage credentials (usernames and passwords) that your runbooks might need to authenticate to other systems or services.
	Connections: 
		These store connection information for specific services or systems, making it easier to manage connections across multiple runbooks. For example, you can create an Azure connection to interact with your Azure subscriptions.
	Hybrid Worker Groups: 
		To manage resources outside of Azure (like on-premises servers), you can configure Hybrid Workers. These are agents installed on your non-Azure machines that can execute runbooks locally.
	
	DSC (Desired State Configuration): 
		Azure Automation State Configuration is a managed DSC service that allows you to define and enforce the desired configuration of your Windows and Linux servers.
	Nodes: 
		The servers you are managing with DSC.
	Configurations: 
		PowerShell scripts that define the desired state of your nodes.
	Node Configurations: 
		Compiled MOF (Managed Object Format) documents that apply a specific configuration to a node.
	Compilation Jobs: 
		Processes that compile DSC configurations into node configurations.
	Pull Server: 
		The Azure Automation DSC service acts as a pull server, where nodes periodically check for and apply their assigned configurations.
	Update Management: 
		A feature built on top of Azure Automation that allows you to manage and deploy operating system updates to your Azure and non-Azure VMs.
	Change Tracking and Inventory: 
		Another feature leveraging Azure Automation, providing insights into changes in your VMs' software, services, registry, and files.

Common Use Cases for Azure Automation:

	Starting and stopping Azure VMs on a schedule.
	Patching and updating operating systems on VMs.
	Automating backups and restores.
	Managing Azure resources (creating, deleting, scaling).
	Deploying applications and configurations.
	Monitoring system health and responding to alerts.
	Orchestrating complex workflows across multiple systems.
	Managing hybrid environments (on-premises servers).
	Enforcing desired state configurations on servers.
Getting Started with Azure Automation:

	Create an Automation Account: 
		You'll need an Automation Account in your Azure subscription.
	Explore the Azure Portal: 
		Familiarize yourself with the different sections of your Automation Account.
	Create your first Runbook: 
		Start with a simple PowerShell or Python script.
	Test and Publish your Runbook: 
		Ensure it works as expected and then make it available for scheduling or manual execution.
	Link to a Schedule: 
		Automate the execution of your runbook.
	Explore other features: 
		Investigate Modules, Variables, Credentials, DSC, Update Management, etc., as your needs evolve

Introduction to Azure Virtual Networks (VNets)
----------------------------------------------------------------


Azure Virtual Network (VNet) is a fundamental building block for your private network in Azure. It provides an isolated, logically segmented network within the Azure cloud, allowing you to launch Azure resources (like Virtual Machines, Azure App Service Environments, Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) clusters, etc.) and enable them to communicate securely with each other, the internet, and your on-premises networks.

Think of a VNet as your own private data center within Azure. You have full control over its IP address range, subnets, security policies, and routing configurations.

Key Concepts and Components of Azure VNets:

Address Space: When you create a VNet, you define one or more contiguous, non-overlapping IP address ranges in CIDR (Classless Inter-Domain Routing) notation (e.g., 10.0.0.0/16). This defines the private IP address space for all resources within that VNet.
Subnets: You divide the VNet's address space into one or more subnets. Each subnet is a logical grouping of IP addresses within the VNet's range. Subnets help you organize and secure your resources. For example, you might have separate subnets for web servers, application servers, and databases.
Regions: A VNet is scoped to a single Azure region. However, you can connect VNets in different regions using VNet peering or Azure Virtual WAN.
Availability Zones: Within a region that supports Availability Zones, you can deploy resources within a subnet across multiple availability zones for higher availability and fault tolerance.
Security: VNets provide a natural layer of isolation. Resources within a VNet can communicate with each other privately. You can further enhance security using:
Network Security Groups (NSGs): Stateful firewalls that control inbound and outbound traffic at the subnet and network interface (NIC) level.
Application Security Groups (ASGs): Enable you to group VMs by application and apply security rules based on those groups, simplifying management for complex applications.
Azure Firewall: A managed, cloud-based network security service that provides advanced threat protection, filtering, and centralized policy management.
Routing: Azure automatically routes traffic between subnets within a VNet. You can also create custom routes (User-Defined Routes - UDRs) to control how traffic is routed, for example, to a network virtual appliance (NVA) for advanced security or monitoring.
Connectivity: VNets enable various connectivity scenarios:
Intra-VNet Communication: Resources within the same VNet can communicate with each other using private IP addresses.
Internet Connectivity: Resources in a VNet can communicate with the internet using public IP addresses (associated directly or via a Network Address Translation (NAT) gateway).
On-premises Connectivity: You can connect your VNet to your on-premises network using:
Azure VPN Gateway: Creates secure, encrypted tunnels (Site-to-Site VPN or Point-to-Site VPN).
Azure ExpressRoute: Provides a dedicated, private, high-bandwidth connection.
Inter-VNet Connectivity: You can connect VNets together using:
VNet Peering: Connects VNets in the same or different regions through the Azure backbone network, allowing resources in different VNets to communicate using private IP addresses.
Azure Virtual WAN: A networking service that provides optimized and automated branch-to-Azure and Azure-to-Azure connectivity.
Service Endpoints: Provide secure and direct connectivity to Azure service resources (like Azure Storage, Azure SQL Database, Azure Cosmos DB) over the Azure backbone network, without exposing your VNet to the public internet.
Private Endpoints: Provide private and secure connectivity to Azure services from within your VNet using a private IP address from your VNet's address space. This eliminates the need for public IP addresses and keeps traffic within the Azure network.
Benefits of Using Azure VNets:

Isolation and Security: Provides a private and isolated network environment for your Azure resources.
Control: You have full control over the network topology, IP addressing, routing, and security policies.
Scalability: Easily scale your network as your application and resource needs grow.
Hybrid Connectivity: Seamlessly connect your Azure environment to your on-premises infrastructure.
High Availability and Resilience: Design highly available applications by deploying resources across subnets and Availability Zones within a VNet.
Integration with Azure Services: VNets are the foundation for connecting and securing various Azure services.
Common Use Cases for Azure VNets:

Hosting Azure Virtual Machines: Deploying VMs within a VNet allows them to communicate privately and securely.
Creating Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) Clusters: AKS clusters are deployed within a VNet, providing network isolation for your containerized applications.
Deploying Azure App Service Environments (ASEs): ASEs are deployed into a subnet within a VNet, offering a dedicated and isolated environment for your web applications.
Connecting Azure to On-premises Networks: Establishing hybrid connectivity using VPN Gateway or ExpressRoute.
Securing Azure Services: Using Service Endpoints and Private Endpoints to restrict access to Azure services from within your VNet.
Building Multi-Tier Applications: Architecting applications with different tiers (web, application, database) deployed in separate subnets with controlled communication using NSGs.
Implementing Network Virtual Appliances (NVAs): Deploying third-party security or networking appliances (like firewalls or load balancers) within a VNet and routing traffic through them using UDRs.
Getting Started with Azure VNets:

You can create and manage Azure VNets using various tools:

Azure Portal: A web-based graphical user interface.
Azure CLI: A command-line tool for managing Azure resources.
Azure PowerShell: A set of cmdlets for managing Azure resources using PowerShell.
Azure Resource Manager (ARM) Templates or Bicep: Infrastructure-as-Code tools for defining and deploying your VNet and associated resources.

Azure firewall Vs Microsoft defender for cloud 
----------------------------------------------	
	
Azure Firewall and Microsoft Defender for Cloud 
	both crucial security services offered by Microsoft Azure, but they serve distinct purposes and provide different types of protection for your cloud environment. They are often used together to create a more comprehensive security posture.

Azure Firewall:

	Type of Service: 
		Network Security Firewall (specifically, a managed, cloud-based network security service).
	Primary Function: 
		To protect your Azure Virtual Network (VNet) resources by controlling network traffic. It acts as a stateful firewall, inspecting both inbound and outbound traffic based on configured rules.
	Scope of Protection: 
		Primarily focuses on network-level security within and entering/leaving your Azure VNets. It can also control traffic between spoke VNets in a hub-and-spoke architecture and hybrid connections.
	Key Features:
		Stateful Firewall: 
			Inspects traffic context, not just individual packets.
			Connection Tracking (State Table): The firewall maintains a state table (or connection table) that records details about each active network connection. This table typically includes information like:
			Source and destination IP addresses
			Source and destination port numbers
			Protocol (TCP, UDP, ICMP, etc.)
			Sequence numbers (for TCP)
			The current state of the connection (e.g., SYN sent, ESTABLISHED, FIN received)
			Contextual Analysis: 
				When a new packet arrives, the stateful firewall doesn't just look at the header information (like a stateless firewall). It also checks if this packet belongs to an existing, legitimate connection recorded in its state table.
				Dynamic Rule Creation: For connection-oriented protocols like TCP, the firewall monitors the connection establishment process (the three-way handshake)
				Stateful Inspection: The firewall examines the packet headers and sometimes even the payload to ensure that the traffic is consistent with the expected state of the connection.
				Virtual Connections for Stateless Protocols: For connectionless protocols like UDP and ICMP, which don't have a formal handshake, stateful firewalls often create a "virtual connection" by tracking the request and expecting a corresponding response within a certain timeframe.
				Connection Termination: The firewall also monitors the connection termination process (e.g., TCP FIN packets) and removes the entry from the state table once the connection is closed.
		Built-in High Availability: 
			Designed for resilience.
		Unrestricted Cloud Scalability: 
			Automatically scales to handle changing network traffic.
		Application FQDN Filtering: 
			Controls outbound HTTP/S traffic to specified Fully Qualified Domain Names (including wildcards).
		Network Traffic Filtering Rules: 
			Creates allow/deny rules based on source/destination IP addresses, ports, and protocols.
		FQDN Tags: 
			Simplifies allowing traffic to well-known Azure services (e.g., Windows Update).
		Service Tags: 
			Similar to FQDN tags but for broader Azure services.
		Threat Intelligence-based Filtering: 
			Can block traffic to/from known malicious IP addresses and domains (available in Standard and Premium SKUs).
		DNS Proxy and Custom DNS: 
			Enhances DNS security (Standard and Premium).
		Web Categories: 
			Allows/denies user access to website categories (e.g., gambling, social media) (Standard and Premium).
		TLS Inspection: 
			Decrypts outbound traffic, performs security checks, and re-encrypts (Premium).
		Intrusion Detection and Prevention System (IDPS): 
			Signature-based detection of malicious activity (Premium).
		URL Filtering: 
			Controls access to specific URLs (Premium).
		Management: 
			Centralized management of network and application rules across multiple subscriptions and VNets is possible through Azure Firewall Manager.
		Goal: 
			To enforce network security policies, control traffic flow, and prevent unauthorized access at the network and application layers.
Microsoft Defender for Cloud (formerly Azure Security Center):

	Type of Service: 
		Cloud Security Posture Management (CSPM) and Cloud Workload Protection Platform (CWPP).
	Primary Function: 
		To provide unified security management and advanced threat protection across your Azure, hybrid, and multicloud (AWS, GCP) environments. It helps you understand your security posture, identify and prioritize threats, and get recommendations to improve your overall security.
	Scope of Protection: Covers a broad range of resources, including virtual machines, databases, containers, storage accounts, networks, and applications, across different cloud environments and on-premises.
	Key Features:
	Security Posture Management (CSPM):
	Continuous Assessment: Regularly evaluates your resources against security best practices and compliance standards.
	Secure Score: Provides a single score to understand your overall security posture.
	Recommendations: Offers actionable advice to remediate security vulnerabilities and misconfigurations.
	Regulatory Compliance: Helps you meet industry and regulatory requirements.
	Asset Inventory: Provides visibility into your cloud resources.
	Attack Path Analysis: Identifies potential attack vectors and prioritizes high-risk vulnerabilities.
	Cloud Workload Protection (CWP):
	Threat Detection: Uses advanced analytics and threat intelligence to identify malicious activities.
	Behavioral Analytics: Detects anomalous behavior in your workloads.
	Vulnerability Assessment: Scans your VMs, containers, and databases for known vulnerabilities.
	Adaptive Application Controls: Helps define security rules for applications running on VMs.
	File Integrity Monitoring: Detects unauthorized changes to critical system and application files.
	Just-in-Time (JIT) VM Access: Limits unnecessary open ports on VMs.
	Integration with Microsoft Defender for Endpoint: Provides endpoint detection and response capabilities for servers.
	Protection Plans for Specific Workloads: Offers tailored protection for servers, containers, databases, storage, App Service, Key Vault, and more.
	Management: Provides a centralized dashboard in the Azure portal for monitoring and managing security across your environment.
	Goal: To improve your cloud security posture, detect and respond to threats, ensure compliance, and provide workload-specific protection.
Here's an analogy to help understand the difference:

Imagine securing a physical building:

Azure Firewall is like the perimeter fence, security guards at the gates, and access control systems that manage who and what can enter and leave the property and move between different areas within. It controls the traffic flow.
Microsoft Defender for Cloud is like the overall security system, including surveillance cameras, motion detectors inside the building, regular security audits, and recommendations on how to improve the building's security (e.g., stronger locks, better lighting). It provides continuous monitoring, threat detection, and guidance on strengthening the entire security framework.

IP Address Spaces and Address Ranges
----------------------------------------------------------------


IP Address Spaces and Address Ranges in Azure Virtual Networks (VNets) using Azure CLI (az vnet)
When working with Azure Virtual Networks (VNets) using the Azure CLI's az vnet command group, understanding IP address spaces and address ranges is fundamental. Here's an overview of these concepts and how they relate to az vnet:

1. IP Address Space:

Definition: The IP address space of a VNet is a range of private IP addresses that you define when creating the VNet. This range is specified in CIDR (Classless Inter-Domain Routing) notation (e.g., 10.0.0.0/16, 172.16.0.0/12, 192.168.0.0/24).
Private IP Addresses: VNets exclusively use private IP addresses as defined in RFC 1918. These addresses are not routable on the public internet.
Contiguous Block: The IP address space you define must be a single, contiguous block. You cannot specify multiple disjointed ranges when initially creating the VNet.
Uniqueness: The IP address space of a VNet should not overlap with the IP address spaces of other VNets you connect to (via VNet peering or VPN/ExpressRoute) or your on-premises networks to avoid routing conflicts.
Size Limits: Azure supports a maximum of one IP address space for a VNet during creation. However, you can add up to four additional non-overlapping CIDR address ranges to an existing VNet after its creation. The total address space for a VNet is limited to 65,536 IP addresses.
Using az vnet to Manage IP Address Space:

Creating a VNet with an Initial Address Space:



az network vnet create \
  --resource-group myResourceGroup \
  --name myVNet \
  --address-prefixes 10.0.0.0/16 \
  --location eastus
Here, --address-prefixes 10.0.0.0/16 specifies the initial IP address space for the myVNet.

Adding an Additional Address Space to an Existing VNet:



az network vnet update \
  --resource-group myResourceGroup \
  --name myVNet \
  --address-prefixes 10.0.0.0/16 192.168.1.0/24
This command updates the myVNet to include the additional address space 192.168.1.0/24. Note that you need to include the existing prefixes as well when updating.

Listing the Address Prefixes of a VNet:



az network vnet show \
  --resource-group myResourceGroup \
  --name myVNet \
  --query addressSpace.addressPrefixes
This command will output a JSON array containing the configured address prefixes for the VNet.

2. Subnet Address Ranges:

Definition: Subnets are subdivisions of the VNet's IP address space. When you create a subnet within a VNet, you assign a specific range of IP addresses from the VNet's overall address space to that subnet.
CIDR Notation: Subnet address ranges are also defined using CIDR notation. The prefix of the subnet must be within the prefix of the VNet. For example, if your VNet has an address space of 10.0.0.0/16, you can create subnets with ranges like 10.0.1.0/24, 10.0.2.0/24, etc.
Uniqueness within VNet: Subnet address ranges within the same VNet must be unique and cannot overlap.
Azure Reserved Addresses: Azure reserves the first five and the last IP addresses within each subnet for its internal use (e.g., network address, broadcast address, Azure DNS, default gateway, future use). These addresses are not available for assignment to resources. For example, in a /24 subnet (256 addresses), only 251 are usable.
Using az vnet subnet to Manage Subnet Address Ranges:

Creating a Subnet with an Address Range:



az network vnet subnet create \
  --resource-group myResourceGroup \
  --vnet-name myVNet \
  --name mySubnet \
  --address-prefixes 10.0.1.0/24
Here, --address-prefixes 10.0.1.0/24 defines the address range for the mySubnet, which must be within the VNet's address space (10.0.0.0/16 in this case).

Adding an Additional Address Prefix to an Existing Subnet (Requires the Subnet feature flag to be enabled for your subscription):



az network vnet subnet update \
  --resource-group myResourceGroup \
  --vnet-name myVNet \
  --name mySubnet \
  --address-prefixes 10.0.1.0/24 10.0.2.0/24
Similar to updating the VNet's address space, you need to include existing prefixes when adding new ones. Important: This functionality of having multiple address prefixes per subnet is a newer feature and might require enabling a preview feature flag in your Azure subscription.

Listing the Address Prefix of a Subnet:



az network vnet subnet show \
  --resource-group myResourceGroup \
  --vnet-name myVNet \
  --name mySubnet \
  --query addressPrefix
This command will output the primary address prefix of the specified subnet. If multiple prefixes are configured (with the feature flag enabled), use --query addressPrefixes to see all of them.

Updating the Address Prefix of a Subnet:



az network vnet subnet update \
  --resource-group myResourceGroup \
  --vnet-name myVNet \
  --name mySubnet \
  --address-prefixes 10.0.3.0/24
This command changes the address prefix of mySubnet to 10.0.3.0/24. Ensure this new range is within the VNet's address space and doesn't overlap with other subnets.

Key Considerations When Planning IP Address Spaces and Ranges:

Scalability: Plan your VNet address space with future growth in mind. It's easier to start with a larger range than to try and expand later, which can involve downtime and complexity.
Organization: Use subnets to logically organize your resources based on function, security requirements, or environment. 
Connectivity: Consider the IP address ranges of networks you might want to connect to (on-premises, other VNets) to avoid overlaps.
Azure Service Requirements: Some Azure services might have specific subnet requirements (e.g., Azure Firewall, Gateway Subnet). 
Address Space Limitations: Be aware of the limits on the number and size of address spaces and subnets per VNet.

----------------------------------------------------------------
Regional Scope of VNets
----------------------------------------------------------------



The scope of Azure Virtual Networks (VNets) is regional. This means that a VNet you create is tied to a specific Azure region (e.g., East US, West Europe, Southeast Asia). All the resources you deploy within that VNet, such as virtual machines, Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) clusters, and App Service Environments, must also reside in the same region as the VNet.

Here's a breakdown of the regional scope and its implications:

Key Aspects of Regional Scope:

Single Region Confinement: When you create a VNet, you must choose a specific Azure region. All subnets and resources created within that VNet are bound to that region.
Availability Zones: While a VNet itself spans across all Availability Zones within a region, the resources you deploy within its subnets can be placed in specific Availability Zones for higher availability. You don't need to create separate VNets or subnets for each Availability Zone.
Inter-Resource Communication within a Region: Resources within the same VNet, regardless of the Availability Zone they are in, can communicate with each other using private IP addresses with low latency.
Isolation within a Region: By default, VNets within the same region are isolated from each other. To enable communication between different VNets (even in the same region), you need to establish VNet peering.
Connectivity to Resources Outside the Region:
Internet: Resources in a VNet can connect to the public internet through public IP addresses or NAT Gateways.
Other Azure Services: You can use Service Endpoints and Private Endpoints to securely connect to other Azure services within or outside the region, often keeping traffic within the Azure backbone network.
On-premises Networks: You can establish connections to your on-premises networks using Azure VPN Gateway or Azure ExpressRoute, which can span across regions.
Other VNets in Different Regions: To connect VNets in different Azure regions, you use Global VNet Peering or Azure Virtual WAN.
Why is VNet Scope Regional?

The regional scope of VNets aligns with the fundamental architecture of Azure, where resources are typically deployed within specific geographic locations for factors like:

Latency: Keeping resources that need to communicate closely within the same region minimizes network latency.
Compliance and Data Sovereignty: Some regulatory requirements mandate that data and applications reside within specific geographic boundaries.
Fault Isolation: Regional isolation helps to contain the impact of failures within a specific geographic area.
Connecting VNets Across Regions:

While VNets are regional, Azure provides mechanisms to connect them across different regions:

Global VNet Peering: This allows you to connect VNets in different Azure regions, enabling resources in those VNets to communicate using private IP addresses. It provides low-latency, high-bandwidth connectivity across the Azure backbone.
Azure Virtual WAN: This is a networking service designed for creating large-scale global network topologies. It simplifies connectivity between VNets across regions and to on-premises locations.

Introduction to Subnets
----------------------------------------------------------------

Introduction to Subnets
In the context of networking, a subnet (short for subnetwork) is a logical subdivision of an IP network. It allows you to divide a larger network into smaller, more manageable, and logically organized segments. This segmentation provides several benefits for network administration, performance, and security.

Think of a larger IP network as a big apartment building, and subnets as individual apartments within that building. Each apartment (subnet) has its own range of addresses and occupants (devices), but they all reside within the same overall building (the larger IP network).

Key Concepts of Subnets:

IP Address Range Division: When you create a subnet, you take a portion of the larger network's IP address range and allocate it to that specific subnet. This is done using subnetting, a process that involves manipulating the network mask.
Network Mask: A network mask (or subnet mask) is a 32-bit number (in IPv4) that separates the IP address into two parts: the network portion and the host portion.
The contiguous '1' bits in the network mask identify the network.
The contiguous '0' bits in the network mask identify the host portion within that network.
Subnetting involves borrowing bits from the host portion of the IP address and using them to define additional network segments (subnets). This results in a longer network portion (more '1's in the mask) and a smaller host portion (fewer '0's), meaning fewer usable host addresses per subnet but more subnets overall.
Broadcast Domain: Each subnet represents its own broadcast domain. A broadcast message sent within one subnet will only reach devices within that same subnet and will not be forwarded to other subnets by a standard Layer 2 switch. This helps to limit network traffic and improve efficiency.
Logical Organization: Subnets allow you to logically group devices based on their function, department, security requirements, or physical location. For example, you might have separate subnets for servers, workstations, printers, or different departments within an organization.
Security Boundaries: Subnets can act as security boundaries. You can implement access control lists (ACLs) or firewall rules at the router or Layer 3 switch level to control traffic flow between different subnets, enhancing network security.
Performance Optimization: By dividing a large network into smaller subnets, you can reduce network congestion and improve performance. Local traffic stays within the subnet, and only traffic destined for other subnets needs to be routed.
Network Administration: Subnets simplify network administration by making it easier to manage IP address allocation, troubleshoot network issues, and implement security policies for specific groups of devices.
How Subnetting Works (Simplified):

Imagine you have a Class C network with the address 192.168.1.0 and a default subnet mask of 255.255.255.0 (/24). This gives you 254 usable host addresses.

If you need two subnets, you can "borrow" one bit from the host portion of the IP address for subnetting. This changes the subnet mask to 255.255.255.128 (/25).

Subnet 1: 192.168.1.0 - 192.168.1.127 (usable hosts: 192.168.1.1 - 192.168.1.126)
Subnet 2: 192.168.1.128 - 192.168.1.255 (usable hosts: 192.168.1.129 - 192.168.1.254)
You've now created two subnets, each with fewer usable host addresses but providing logical separation.

Subnets in Cloud Environments (e.g., Azure VNets):

The concept of subnets is equally important in cloud networking, such as within Azure Virtual Networks (VNets). When you create a VNet, you divide its IP address space into one or more subnets. This allows you to:

Organize Azure Resources: Deploy different types of resources (e.g., VMs, databases, application gateways) into separate subnets for better management and security.
Implement Network Security Groups (NSGs): Apply NSGs to specific subnets to control inbound and outbound traffic for all resources within that subnet.
Define Route Tables: Associate route tables with subnets to customize the routing of traffic leaving those subnets.
Integrate with Azure Services: Some Azure services have specific subnet requirements or recommendations for deployment.

----------------------------------------------------------------
Public Vs Private Subnet
----------------------------------------------------------------

In Azure, the distinction between a "public" and "private" subnet isn't a configuration setting you explicitly define with the az vnet subnet command. Instead, it's determined by the routing configuration associated with the subnet and whether resources within that subnet have a public IP address assigned to them.

Here's a breakdown of how to understand public vs. private subnets in the context of Azure and az vnet:

Public Subnet:

A subnet is generally considered "public" if it has a route to an Internet Gateway (IGW) associated with its Virtual Network (VNet). Resources in a public subnet can directly communicate with the public internet if they are also assigned a public IP address (either directly or through an associated Load Balancer).

Key characteristics of a public subnet:

Route to Internet Gateway: The subnet's route table contains a route with the destination 0.0.0.0/0 and the NextHopType set to Internet. This route directs internet-bound traffic from the subnet to the IGW.
Public IP Addresses: Resources in a public subnet typically have a public IP address assigned to their Network Interface (NIC) or are part of a Load Balancer with a public IP address. This allows them to initiate outbound connections to the internet and receive inbound connections from the internet (if allowed by Network Security Groups).
How az vnet relates to public subnets:

Creating a VNet with an Internet Gateway (IGW): You first need to create an IGW in your VNet's region.


az network public-ip create --resource-group myResourceGroup --name myPublicIPForGW --allocation-method Static
az network vnet-gateway create --resource-group myResourceGroup --name myVNetGateway --location eastus --vnet myVNet --public-ip-address myPublicIPForGW --gateway-type Vpn --vpn-type RouteBased
(Note: While a VPN Gateway includes internet-facing components, a dedicated Internet Gateway resource doesn't exist as a standalone entity in Azure like it does in AWS. Internet connectivity is primarily managed through default outbound access or by associating public IPs and ensuring routing.)
Creating a Route Table with a Route to the Internet:


az network route-table create --resource-group myResourceGroup --name myPublicSubnetRouteTable --location eastus
az network route-table route create --resource-group myResourceGroup --route-table-name myPublicSubnetRouteTable --name default --address-prefix 0.0.0.0/0 --next-hop-type Internet
Associating the Route Table with the Subnet:


az network vnet subnet update --resource-group myResourceGroup --name myPublicSubnet --vnet-name myVNet --route-table myPublicSubnetRouteTable
Assigning Public IPs to Resources: You would then associate public IP addresses to the NICs of VMs or the frontend of Load Balancers within this subnet.


az network public-ip create --resource-group myResourceGroup --name myPublicIPForVM --allocation-method Static
az network nic ip-config update --resource-group myResourceGroup --nic-name myVMNic --name ipconfig1 --public-ip-address myPublicIPForVM
Private Subnet:

A subnet is generally considered "private" if it does not have a direct route to an Internet Gateway. Resources in a private subnet cannot directly initiate outbound connections to the public internet or receive inbound connections from it without additional configuration.

Key characteristics of a private subnet:

No Direct Route to Internet Gateway: The subnet's route table either doesn't have a 0.0.0.0/0 route pointing to the internet, or it directs that traffic to a different next hop, such as a Network Virtual Appliance (NVA) or an Azure NAT Gateway.
No Public IP Addresses (Typically): Resources in a private subnet usually do not have public IP addresses directly assigned to them.
Outbound Internet Access (Optional, via NAT): Resources in a private subnet can gain outbound internet access through:
Azure NAT Gateway: A fully managed and highly available Network Address Translation (NAT) service. You associate a NAT Gateway with the private subnet.


az network nat gateway create --resource-group myResourceGroup --name myNATGateway --location eastus --public-ip-addresses myPublicIPForNAT
az network vnet subnet update --resource-group myResourceGroup --name myPrivateSubnet --vnet-name myVNet --nat-gateway myNATGateway
Network Virtual Appliance (NVA): A VM acting as a firewall or proxy that routes traffic to the internet. You would create User-Defined Routes (UDRs) to direct internet-bound traffic to the NVA's private IP address.


az network route-table create --resource-group myResourceGroup --name myPrivateSubnetRouteTable --location eastus
az network route-table route create --resource-group myResourceGroup --route-table-name myPrivateSubnetRouteTable --name default --address-prefix 0.0.0.0/0 --next-hop-type VirtualAppliance --next-hop-ip-address <NVA_Private_IP>
az network vnet subnet update --resource-group myResourceGroup --name myPrivateSubnet --vnet-name myVNet --route-table myPrivateSubnetRouteTable
Inbound Access: Inbound access to resources in a private subnet from the internet typically requires a service like Azure Load Balancer or Azure Application Gateway, which have public IP addresses and forward traffic to the private IP addresses of the backend instances.
How az vnet relates to private subnets:

Creating a Subnet without a Default Internet Route: By default, Azure provides outbound internet access from all subnets. To make a subnet private, you need to override this default behavior.
Creating a Route Table without an Internet Route (or with a route to a NAT Gateway/NVA): As shown in the examples above, you create a route table that directs traffic differently than the internet.
Associating the Route Table with the Subnet: Use the az network vnet subnet update command to associate the custom route table with your private subnet.
Deploying Resources without Public IPs: When creating VMs or other resources in the private subnet, you would typically omit the --public-ip-address parameter during creation.

Deploying Resources without Public IPs: When creating VMs or other resources in the private subnet, you would typically omit the --public-ip-address parameter during creation.

----------------------------------------------------------------
IP Address Ranges within Subnets
----------------------------------------------------------------


When working with Azure Virtual Networks (VNets) and subnets using the Azure CLI (az network vnet subnet commands), you need to define the IP address range for both the VNet and each subnet within it. Here's a breakdown of how this works:

1. VNet IP Address Space
When you create a VNet using az network vnet create, you specify one or more contiguous private IP address prefixes using the --address-prefixes parameter.
These prefixes define the overall IP address space for your VNet.
Azure recommends using private IP address ranges defined in RFC 1918 (10.0.0.0/8, 172.16.0.0/12, 192.168.0.0/16) or the shared address space in RFC 6598 (100.64.0.0/10).
The address prefixes must not overlap with each other or with other VNets or on-premises networks you intend to connect to.
You can add up to four additional non-overlapping CIDR address ranges to an existing VNet after creation using az network vnet update --address-prefixes.
Example:



az network vnet create \
    --resource-group myResourceGroup \
    --name myVNet \
    --address-prefixes 10.0.0.0/16 192.168.0.0/24 \
    --location eastus
2. Subnet IP Address Ranges
When you create a subnet within a VNet using az network vnet subnet create, you define its IP address range using the --address-prefixes parameter.
The address range you specify for a subnet must be within one of the address prefixes defined for the VNet.
Subnet address ranges must be unique within the VNet and cannot overlap with other subnets.
Azure reserves the first four and the last IP addresses within each subnet for its internal use (network address, gateway, Azure DNS IPs, broadcast address). These addresses are not available for assignment to resources.
Example:

Assuming myVNet has the address prefix 10.0.0.0/16:



az network vnet subnet create \
    --resource-group myResourceGroup \
    --vnet-name myVNet \
    --name webSubnet \
    --address-prefixes 10.0.1.0/24

az network vnet subnet create \
    --resource-group myResourceGroup \
    --vnet-name myVNet \
    --name dbSubnet \
    --address-prefixes 10.0.2.0/24
3. Managing Subnet Address Ranges with az vnet subnet
Creating a subnet with an address range: Use az network vnet subnet create with the --address-prefixes parameter.
Listing subnet address range: Use az network vnet subnet show with the --query addressPrefix (for the primary prefix) or --query addressPrefixes (if multiple prefixes are enabled).
Updating subnet address range: Use az network vnet subnet update with the --address-prefixes parameter. If the subnet contains resources, you might need to move or delete them before changing the address range.
Adding multiple address prefixes to a subnet: This is a newer feature that might require enabling a feature flag for your subscription. Use az network vnet subnet update --address-prefixes with a space-separated list of prefixes. Ensure all prefixes are within the VNet's address space and don't overlap.
4. Subnet Size and Usable IPs
The size of a subnet is defined by its CIDR prefix. A /24 subnet has 256 total IP addresses, while a /27 subnet has 32, and so on.
Remember that Azure reserves five IP addresses in each subnet. Therefore, the number of usable IP addresses in a subnet is the total number of addresses minus five.
Example:

/24 subnet (256 addresses) = 251 usable IP addresses
/27 subnet (32 addresses) = 27 usable IP addresses
Important Considerations
Plan your IP address ranges carefully considering your current and future needs. It's generally easier to start with larger ranges than to try and modify them later.
Ensure non-overlapping address spaces for VNets and subnets to avoid routing issues.
Be aware of the Azure reserved IP addresses within each subnet when planning the size of your subnets.
Some Azure services might have specific subnet size requirements or recommendations (e.g., Azure Firewall, Application Gateway).

----------------------------------------------------------------
Subnet Association with Resources
----------------------------------------------------------------

Subnet association with resources in Azure is a fundamental concept for network organization, security, and communication within a Virtual Network (VNet). When you deploy an Azure resource that requires network connectivity, you must associate it with a specific subnet within a VNet.

Here's a breakdown of how subnet association works and why it's important:

How Resources are Associated with Subnets:

During Resource Creation: When you create a network-dependent Azure resource (like a Virtual Machine, Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) node, Azure App Service Environment instance, Network Interface Card (NIC), etc.), one of the configuration steps involves selecting the VNet and then the specific subnet within that VNet where the resource will be deployed.
Network Interface (NIC): For many compute resources (like VMs), the association happens at the level of the Network Interface Card (NIC). The NIC is connected to a subnet, and the VM uses that NIC for network communication. A VM can have multiple NICs, each associated with a different subnet (within the same VNet).
Service-Specific Association: Some Azure services have their own mechanisms for subnet association. For example:
AKS: The nodes of an AKS cluster are deployed into subnets within a VNet. You typically specify a subnet for the node pool.
Azure App Service Environment (ASE): An ASE is deployed into a dedicated subnet within a VNet.
Azure Load Balancer: While the Load Balancer itself isn't directly in a subnet, its backend pool instances (VMs) are in subnets within the same VNet or peered VNets.
Azure Application Gateway: The Application Gateway is deployed into a dedicated subnet.
Azure Firewall: An Azure Firewall is deployed into a dedicated subnet (often named AzureFirewallSubnet).
Private Endpoints: A private endpoint is created within a specific subnet in your VNet and represents a private IP address for an Azure service.
What Happens When a Resource is Associated with a Subnet:

Private IP Address Allocation: The resource (or its associated NIC) is assigned a private IP address from the IP address range of the subnet it's connected to. Azure automatically manages the allocation of these private IP addresses. You can often specify a static private IP address if needed.
Network Communication: Resources within the same subnet can communicate directly with each other using their private IP addresses without any additional configuration.
Subnet-Level Security: The Network Security Group (NSG) associated with the subnet controls the inbound and outbound traffic for all resources connected to that subnet (unless a more specific NSG is applied at the NIC level).
Subnet-Level Routing: The Route Table associated with the subnet determines how outbound traffic from the resources in that subnet is routed. This allows you to control the next hop for traffic destined for different networks (e.g., the internet, other VNets, on-premises).
Service Endpoints: If Service Endpoints are enabled on a subnet for a specific Azure service, resources in that subnet can securely access that service over the Azure backbone network without requiring public IP addresses.
Private Endpoints: Resources in a subnet containing a private endpoint can securely access the target Azure service using the private IP address allocated to the endpoint within that subnet.
Why Subnet Association is Important:

Network Organization: Subnets provide a logical way to organize your Azure resources based on their function, application tier, security requirements, or environment.
Security Control: Applying NSGs at the subnet level provides a consistent security posture for a group of related resources. This simplifies security management compared to managing individual firewall rules on each resource.
Traffic Management: Route Tables associated with subnets allow you to control the flow of network traffic, enabling scenarios like forcing traffic through network appliances (firewalls, NVAs) for inspection.
Isolation: Subnets create network boundaries. By default, resources in different subnets within the same VNet need explicit rules (in NSGs) to communicate with each other.
Integration with Azure Services: Many Azure services have specific requirements or best practices related to subnet association for proper functionality and security.
Tools for Managing Subnet Associations:

You typically configure subnet associations when you create the Azure resource using:

Azure Portal: During the resource creation wizard, you'll be prompted to select the VNet and subnet.
Azure CLI: Most resource creation commands (e.g., az vm create, az aks create) have parameters to specify the --vnet-name and --subnet. For NICs, you use az network nic create or az network nic ip-config create with subnet information.
Azure PowerShell: Similar to the CLI, PowerShell cmdlets for resource creation (e.g., New-AzVM, New-AzAksCluster) have parameters for specifying virtual network and subnet configurations.
Azure Resource Manager (ARM) Templates or Bicep: When defining your infrastructure as code, you specify the subnet ID as a property of the network-dependent resources.

----------------------------------------------------------------
System Reserved IP Addresses in Subnets
----------------------------------------------------------------

In Azure Virtual Networks (VNets), when you create a subnet, Azure automatically reserves a small number of IP addresses within that subnet's address range for its own internal use. These system-reserved IP addresses cannot be assigned to your resources (like Virtual Machines).

Understanding these reserved IPs is crucial for properly planning your subnet sizes to ensure you have enough usable IP addresses for your workloads.

Azure reserves a total of 5 IP addresses within each subnet:

Network Address: The first IP address in the subnet range. It's used to identify the subnet itself. For example, in the subnet 10.0.1.0/24, the network address is 10.0.1.0.

Default Gateway: The second IP address in the subnet range. This IP address is used as the default gateway for resources within the subnet to communicate with resources outside the subnet (e.g., in other subnets within the VNet, to the internet, or to peered VNets). For the 10.0.1.0/24 subnet, the default gateway would be 10.0.1.1.

Azure DNS IP Addresses: The third and fourth IP addresses in the subnet range are reserved by Azure to map to the IP addresses of Azure DNS resolvers. In the 10.0.1.0/24 subnet, these would be 10.0.1.2 and 10.0.1.3. Azure provides DNS services to all resources within your VNet, and these reserved IPs are part of that infrastructure.

 Broadcast Address: The last IP address in the subnet range. It's used for sending broadcast messages within the subnet. For the 10.0.1.0/24 subnet, the broadcast address is 10.0.1.255. However, it's important to note that broadcast communication is limited within Azure VNets for performance and security reasons.

Example:

Consider a subnet with the address range 192.168.1.0/24 (256 total IP addresses). The following IP addresses are reserved by Azure:

192.168.1.0: Network address
192.168.1.1: Default gateway
192.168.1.2: Azure DNS IP
192.168.1.3: Azure DNS IP
192.168.1.255: Broadcast address
Therefore, in a /24 subnet, you have 251 usable IP addresses for your Azure resources.

Implications for Subnet Sizing:

When you plan the size of your subnets, you must account for these five reserved IP addresses. Ensure that your chosen subnet size (defined by the CIDR prefix) provides enough usable IP addresses for the number of resources you intend to deploy in that subnet.

For example, if you need to deploy 10 virtual machines in a subnet, a /28 subnet (which provides 16 total IPs and 11 usable IPs) would be sufficient. However, for a larger deployment of, say, 200 VMs, you would need a larger subnet, such as a /24.

Using az to view subnet information:

You can use the Azure CLI (az) to view the address prefixes of your subnets, which helps in understanding the total and therefore the usable IP addresses.



az network vnet subnet show \
    --resource-group <resource_group_name> \
    --vnet-name <vnet_name> \
    --name <subnet_name> \
    --query addressPrefix

----------------------------------------------------------------
Typical production cluster setup.
----------------------------------------------------------------

A typical production cluster setup in Azure, particularly when using Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS), involves careful planning across several key areas to ensure reliability, scalability, security, and cost-effectiveness. Here's a breakdown of the common components and considerations:

1. Virtual Network (VNet) and Subnets:
Dedicated VNet: It's best practice to deploy your production cluster into its own dedicated VNet to provide isolation from other environments (dev, staging) and potentially other applications.
Multiple Subnets: You'll typically need at least two subnets:
Node Pool Subnet(s): This is where your worker nodes will reside. For better availability and scalability, you might have multiple node pools spread across different subnets or availability zones.
Service Subnet: Some services like Azure Application Gateway and Azure Firewall might require their own dedicated subnets.

Sufficient IP Address Space: Plan your VNet and subnet IP ranges carefully, considering the potential growth of your cluster (number of nodes, pods, services with IPs). Using a CIDR range that is too small can lead to IP address exhaustion.
Network Policies: Enable and configure Azure Network Policies or Calico Network Policies to control the traffic flow between pods and namespaces within the cluster, enhancing security.
2. Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) Cluster Configuration:
Production-Ready Kubernetes Version: Use a stable and supported Kubernetes version. Regularly plan for upgrades to newer stable versions to benefit from new features and security patches.
Multiple Node Pools: Utilize multiple node pools to:
Isolate Workloads: Run different types of workloads on nodes with specific configurations (e.g., different VM sizes, OS types, taints, and labels).
Improve Availability: Distribute nodes across availability zones within a region.
Cost Optimization: Use different VM sizes based on the resource requirements of the workloads.
Autoscaling: Enable both Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA) for scaling pods based on metrics like CPU and memory utilization, and Cluster Autoscaler (CA) to automatically adjust the number of nodes in your node pools based on the pending pods.
Availability Zones: Deploy your node pools across multiple availability zones within an Azure region to protect against datacenter-level failures.
Managed Identities: Use Azure Managed Identities for your AKS cluster and applications to securely access other Azure resources (like Azure Container Registry, Key Vault, etc.) without managing credentials within the cluster.
RBAC (Role-Based Access Control): Enable both Kubernetes RBAC and Azure RBAC for fine-grained control over who can access the Kubernetes API server and Azure resources related to the AKS cluster. Integrate with Microsoft Entra ID for centralized identity management.
Private Cluster: For enhanced security, consider deploying a private AKS cluster where the control plane (API server) is only accessible within your private network. You can use Private Link for secure access.
Network Plugin: Choose the appropriate network plugin (Azure CNI or Kubenet) based on your network requirements. Azure CNI provides more advanced networking features and integration with Azure networking.
Add-ons: Utilize relevant AKS add-ons like the HTTP application routing, monitoring, and Azure Policy for AKS to extend the cluster's capabilities and enforce security and compliance.
3. Security:
Network Security Groups (NSGs): Apply NSGs at the subnet level to control inbound and outbound traffic to your worker nodes and other resources within the VNet. Limit access to only necessary ports and protocols.
Azure Firewall: For more advanced network security, consider using Azure Firewall to control egress traffic from your cluster and implement network-level threat protection.
Azure Defender for Cloud: Enable Azure Defender for Cloud for AKS to get security recommendations and threat detection for your Kubernetes environment.
Container Security: Implement security best practices for your container images, including vulnerability scanning, minimal base images, and running as non-root users. Use Azure Container Registry (ACR) with private access and enable content trust.
Secrets Management: Use Azure Key Vault to securely store and manage sensitive information like API keys and connection strings. Integrate AKS with Key Vault using the Secrets Store CSI driver.
Pod Security Policies/Admission Controllers: Implement Pod Security Policies (deprecated in newer Kubernetes versions, consider using Admission Controllers like OPA Gatekeeper or Azure Policy for Kubernetes) to enforce security standards for your pods.
4. Storage:
Azure Managed Disks: Use Azure Managed Disks for persistent volumes to provide reliable and scalable storage for your stateful applications. Consider using Premium SSD for production workloads requiring high performance.
Azure Files: For shared storage needs, Azure Files can be mounted as volumes in your pods.
Storage Classes: Define appropriate Storage Classes to dynamically provision storage based on your application requirements.
5. Load Balancing and Ingress:
Azure Load Balancer (Standard SKU): AKS typically uses Azure Load Balancer (Standard SKU is recommended for production) to distribute external traffic to your services exposed via LoadBalancer type.
Azure Application Gateway: For advanced HTTP/HTTPS traffic management, including SSL termination, WAF (Web Application Firewall), and routing rules, deploy Azure Application Gateway and use the Ingress controller (e.g., Nginx, Traefik) to manage ingress rules and route traffic to your applications within the cluster.
6. Monitoring and Logging:
Azure Monitor for Containers: Enable Azure Monitor for Containers to collect performance metrics, logs, and events from your AKS cluster and containers.
Azure Log Analytics Workspace: Store and analyze your AKS logs in a dedicated Azure Log Analytics Workspace.
Alerting: Set up alerts in Azure Monitor to proactively notify you of critical issues related to your cluster's health and performance.
Application Performance Monitoring (APM): Integrate an APM solution (e.g., Application Insights, Datadog, New Relic) to monitor the performance and health of your applications running in AKS.
7. Disaster Recovery and Business Continuity:
Multi-Region Deployment: For critical applications, consider deploying your AKS cluster and associated resources across multiple Azure regions.
Backup and Restore: Implement a strategy for backing up and restoring your application data and potentially your cluster configuration.
DR Testing: Regularly test your disaster recovery plan to ensure it works as expected.
8. Cost Management:
Right-Sizing: Choose appropriate VM sizes for your node pools based on your workload requirements.
Autoscaling: Properly configure HPA and CA to scale resources up and down based on demand, optimizing resource utilization and cost.
Reserved Instances: For predictable workloads, consider using Azure Reserved VM Instances for your node pools to save on compute costs.
Spot Instances: For non-critical workloads, Azure Spot Virtual Machines can provide significant cost savings.
Azure Cost Management: Use Azure Cost Management tools to monitor and analyze your AKS spending.
9. Infrastructure as Code (IaC):
ARM Templates/Bicep/Terraform: Define and deploy your AKS cluster and its dependencies using IaC tools for consistency, repeatability, and version control.


----------------------------------------------------------------

II. Network Components & Addressing
----------------------------------------------------------------
----------------------------------------------------------------
Network Interface (NIC)
----------------------------------------------------------------

A Network Interface (NIC), also known as a network adapter, LAN adapter, or physical network interface, is a hardware component that connects a device (like a computer, server, or virtual machine) to a computer network. It acts as the intermediary between the device's operating system and the physical network medium (like Ethernet cable or wireless radio waves).

Think of a NIC as the doorway through which your device can communicate with the network. It handles the physical and data-link layer (Layer 1 and Layer 2 of the OSI model) functions necessary for sending and receiving network traffic.

Here's a breakdown of its key functions and aspects:

Key Functions of a Network Interface (NIC):

Physical Connection: Provides the physical port or antenna to connect to the network medium. This could be an Ethernet port (RJ45 connector), a Wi-Fi antenna, a fiber optic connector, etc.
Data Transmission and Reception: Converts the digital data generated by the device into signals that can be transmitted over the network medium and vice versa.
Data Encapsulation and Decapsulation:
Encapsulation (Outgoing): Takes the data from the device's operating system, adds network layer (e.g., IP) and data-link layer (e.g., Ethernet) headers and trailers, forming a frame that can be transmitted over the network. This includes adding source and destination MAC addresses.
Decapsulation (Incoming): Receives frames from the network, checks the destination MAC address to see if it's intended for the device, and then removes the data-link layer headers and trailers, passing the network layer packet up to the operating system.
Media Access Control (MAC) Addressing: Each physical NIC has a unique 48-bit hardware address called the MAC address. This address is used for Layer 2 (data-link layer) communication within the local network segment.
Buffering: NICs often have a small amount of onboard memory (buffer) to temporarily store incoming and outgoing data frames, helping to manage differences in data rates between the device and the network.
Flow Control: Some NICs implement flow control mechanisms to prevent the sending device from overwhelming the receiving device with data.
Interrupt Handling: The NIC generates interrupts to signal the device's CPU when data has arrived or when transmission is complete, allowing the operating system to process network traffic efficiently.
Duplex Communication: Supports different communication modes (half-duplex or full-duplex) to allow for either one-way or simultaneous two-way communication.
Speed Negotiation: For wired connections, NICs can automatically negotiate the optimal communication speed (e.g., 10 Mbps, 100 Mbps, 1 Gbps, 10 Gbps) with the network switch or router.
Power Management: Modern NICs often support power management features to reduce energy consumption when the network is idle.
Types of Network Interfaces:

Physical NICs: These are physical hardware cards or integrated components within a device. Examples include:
Ethernet NICs: For wired connections using Ethernet cables.
Wireless NICs (Wi-Fi Adapters): For connecting to wireless networks.
Fiber Optic NICs: For high-speed connections over fiber optic cables.
Virtual NICs (vNICs): These are software-based network interfaces created by virtualization software (like Hyper-V, VMware, VirtualBox) or cloud platforms (like Azure, AWS, GCP). They allow virtual machines to connect to networks. A vNIC is logically associated with a physical NIC or a software bridge on the host machine.
Network Interface in Azure:

In Azure, a Network Interface (NIC) is a resource that enables a virtual machine (VM) to communicate with virtual network, the internet, and other resources. Key aspects of Azure NICs:

Association with a Subnet: A NIC is always associated with a specific subnet within an Azure Virtual Network (VNet).
Private IP Address: Each NIC is assigned one or more private IP addresses from the subnet's address range.
Public IP Address (Optional): You can optionally associate a public IP address with a NIC to allow inbound communication from the internet.
Network Security Group (NSG) Association: You can associate an NSG with a NIC to control the network traffic to and from the VM at the network interface level. NSG rules are evaluated based on the 5-tuple (source IP, destination IP, source port, destination port, protocol).
IP Configurations: A NIC can have multiple IP configurations, allowing a VM to have multiple private and public IP addresses.
MAC Address: Azure assigns a dynamic MAC address to the NIC of a stopped (deallocated) VM. The MAC address remains the same when the VM is running or stopped (allocated).
Virtual NICs: In the context of Azure, the term "NIC" primarily refers to these virtual network interfaces that connect Azure VMs to the network.

----------------------------------------------------------------
Association with Virtual Machines
----------------------------------------------------------------

In Azure, a Virtual Network Interface Card (vNIC), often simply referred to as a Network Interface (NIC), is the fundamental connection point for a Virtual Machine (VM) to communicate with a virtual network, the internet, and other resources. Think of it as the network adapter for your virtual machine.

Here's a breakdown of the association between vNICs and Virtual Machines in Azure:

1. One-to-Many Relationship:

Every Azure VM must have at least one vNIC associated with it. This is essential for the VM to be able to join and communicate on a virtual network.
A VM can have multiple vNICs attached to it, depending on the size and capabilities of the VM. This allows a VM to connect to multiple subnets within the same Virtual Network (VNet).
2. Association Process:

During VM Creation: When you create a new VM in Azure, the process typically involves creating one or more vNICs and associating them with the VM. You'll specify the VNet and subnet(s) that the vNIC(s) should connect to.
Adding vNICs to Existing VMs: You can add additional vNICs to an existing VM, provided the VM size supports it. The VM must be stopped (deallocated) to add or remove vNICs. The new vNIC must reside in the same Azure location and subscription as the VM and be connected to a VNet in the same location and subscription.
Removing vNICs from VMs: You can detach vNICs from a stopped (deallocated) VM. However, a VM must always have at least one vNIC attached.
3. Key Properties and Configurations of a vNIC:

When a vNIC is associated with a VM, it gets the following properties and configurations:

Association with a Subnet: The vNIC is linked to a specific subnet within a VNet. This determines the range of private IP addresses that can be assigned to the vNIC.
Private IP Address(es): Each vNIC is assigned one or more private IP addresses from the subnet's address range. You can choose between dynamic or static private IP address assignment.
Public IP Address (Optional): You can optionally associate a public IP address with a vNIC to enable inbound communication from the internet. A public IP address is a separate Azure resource and can be either dynamic or static.
Network Security Group (NSG): You can associate an NSG with the vNIC (or the subnet it's connected to) to control inbound and outbound network traffic to the VM. NSGs act as virtual firewalls.
IP Configurations: A vNIC can have multiple IP configurations, allowing the VM to have multiple private and public IP addresses. Each IP configuration has its own set of IP address assignments and can be associated with an NSG.
MAC Address: Azure assigns a MAC address to the vNIC once the VM is started. This MAC address remains the same across reboots and stops (allocated).
Application Security Groups (ASGs): You can associate a vNIC with one or more ASGs. ASGs allow you to group VMs and apply network security policies based on application workload rather than individual IP addresses.
Accelerated Networking (Optional): For supported VM types, you can enable accelerated networking on a vNIC for higher throughput and lower latency.
4. Importance of vNIC Association:

The association of vNICs with VMs is crucial for:

Network Connectivity: It enables the VM to communicate within the Azure VNet, with other Azure services, the internet, and on-premises networks (if a connection is established).
IP Addressing: It determines the private and potentially public IP addresses assigned to the VM.
Network Security: It allows you to apply network security rules (via NSGs) to control traffic at the VM level.
Load Balancing: For VMs in a load balancer backend pool, the vNICs are the endpoints that receive traffic distributed by the load balancer. 
----------------------------------------------------------------
Private and Public IP Addresses
----------------------------------------------------------------
----------------------------------------------------------------
Network Security Group (NSG) Association
----------------------------------------------------------------

In Azure, a Network Security Group (NSG) provides stateful filtering of network traffic to and from Azure resources within a Virtual Network (VNet). An NSG contains security rules that allow or deny network traffic based on a 5-tuple:

Source IP address and port range
Destination IP address and port range
Protocol (TCP, UDP, ICMP, Any)
Direction (Inbound or Outbound)
NSGs can be associated with:

Subnets: When you associate an NSG with a subnet, the rules apply to all resources within that subnet.
Network Interfaces (NICs): When you associate an NSG with a NIC attached to a virtual machine (VM), the rules apply only to that specific VM's network traffic.
You can associate zero or one NSG to each subnet and zero or one NSG to each network interface. The same NSG can be associated with multiple subnets and NICs.

Order of NSG Rule Processing:

When network traffic flows to or from an Azure resource, the NSGs associated with the resource and its subnet are evaluated.

Inbound Traffic:
If there's an NSG associated with the subnet, its rules are processed first.
Then, if there's an NSG associated with the destination NIC, its rules are processed. Traffic is allowed if at least one "Allow" rule with a matching priority is encountered and no "Deny" rule with a higher or equal priority blocks the traffic.
Outbound Traffic:
If there's an NSG associated with the source NIC, its rules are processed first.
Then, if there's an NSG associated with the subnet, its rules are processed. Traffic is allowed if at least one "Allow" rule with a matching priority is encountered and no "Deny" rule with a higher or equal priority blocks the traffic.
Default Security Rules:

Every NSG contains a set of default rules that cannot be deleted but can be overridden by creating custom rules with higher priority. These default rules ensure basic connectivity within the VNet and to the internet:

Inbound:

AllowVNetInBound: Allows all inbound traffic originating from within the same VNet.
AllowAzureLoadBalancerInBound: Allows health probes and traffic from Azure Load Balancers.
DenyAllInBound: Denies all other inbound traffic.
Outbound:

AllowVNetOutBound: Allows all outbound traffic destined for within the same VNet.
AllowInternetOutBound: Allows all outbound traffic to the internet.
DenyAllOutBound: Denies all other outbound traffic.
Creating and Managing NSG Associations:

You can associate and dissociate NSGs using the Azure Portal, Azure CLI, PowerShell, or ARM templates.

Using Azure Portal:

Navigate to the Subnet or Network Interface you want to associate the NSG with.
Under Settings, click on Network security group.
Click Associate and select the desired NSG from the dropdown.
To dissociate, click the "..." next to the associated NSG and select Dissociate.
Using Azure CLI:

Associate NSG to a Subnet:


az network vnet subnet update --resource-group <resource_group_name> --name <subnet_name> --vnet-name <vnet_name> --network-security-group <nsg_name_or_id>
Dissociate NSG from a Subnet:


az network vnet subnet update --resource-group <resource_group_name> --name <subnet_name> --vnet-name <vnet_name> --network-security-group ""
Associate NSG to a Network Interface:


az network nic update --resource-group <resource_group_name> --name <nic_name> --network-security-group <nsg_name_or_id>
Dissociate NSG from a Network Interface:


az network nic update --resource-group <resource_group_name> --name <nic_name> --network-security-group ""
Key Considerations:

Stateless vs. Stateful: NSGs are stateful for established connections. If you allow inbound traffic on a specific port, the corresponding outbound response traffic is automatically allowed, and vice versa.
Priority: Rules are processed in order of priority, with lower numbers having higher priority. Once a rule matches traffic, processing stops.
Security Best Practices: Follow the principle of least privilege when creating NSG rules. Only allow necessary traffic and deny everything else by default.
Service Tags: Use service tags (e.g., Internet, VirtualNetwork, AzureLoadBalancer, Storage) to simplify rule creation for common Azure services.
Application Security Groups (ASGs): Group VMs by application workload and reference ASGs in your NSG rules for easier management in dynamic environments.
Troubleshooting: Use Azure Network Watcher's IP flow verify and NSG flow logs to diagnose connectivity issues related to NSG rules.

----------------------------------------------------------------
IP Addressing in Azure
----------------------------------------------------------------

I. Types of IP Addresses in Azure:

Azure uses both private and public IP addresses to enable communication for your resources.

Private IP Addresses:

	Enable communication between resources within Azure Virtual Networks (VNets) and connected private networks (e.g., on-premises via VPN or ExpressRoute).
	Not directly routable over the public internet.
	Assigned from the address space of the subnet the resource is in.
	Can be assigned using either static or dynamic allocation.
	Resources with only private IP addresses can still communicate outbound to the internet using Azure's default outbound access or a Network Address Translation (NAT) gateway.
	Reserved IP Addresses: Azure reserves the first four and the last IP address in each subnet for its internal use. These cannot be assigned to resources.
Public IP Addresses:

	Allow inbound communication from the internet to Azure resources.
	Enable outbound communication from Azure resources to the internet and public-facing Azure services.
	Can be associated with various Azure resources like VMs, load balancers, application gateways, and VPN gateways.
	Can be either static or dynamically assigned.
	Have a SKU (Basic or Standard) that determines their capabilities and pricing. Standard SKU offers features like availability zones.
	Can be created as non-zonal, zonal, or zone-redundant (for Standard SKU in regions supporting availability zones).
	Have an optional DNS domain name label for name resolution.
II. IP Address Assignment Methods:

Both private and public IP addresses can be assigned using two methods:

Dynamic:

Azure assigns the next available IP address from the relevant pool (subnet for private, Azure region for public) when the resource is created or started.
Private IPs assigned dynamically remain associated with the resource until it's deleted.
Public IPs assigned dynamically are released when the associated resource is stopped or deleted (for VMs).
Dynamic public IPs are typically free when associated with a running VM in the Azure Resource Manager deployment model.
Static:

You manually choose and assign an available IP address from the relevant range.
Private IPs assigned statically remain associated with the network interface until it's deleted or reassigned to a different subnet.
Public IPs assigned statically are reserved and remain allocated to your subscription until you explicitly unassign them, even if the associated resource is stopped or deleted. You are billed for static public IPs even when the associated VM is stopped (deallocated) in the ARM deployment model.
Static public IPs are useful for scenarios requiring a persistent IP address, like DNS records or firewall rules.
III. IP Addressing for Specific Azure Resources:

Virtual Machines (VMs):

Each VM has at least one Network Interface Card (NIC) associated with it.
The NIC is assigned one or more private IP addresses from the connected subnet.
A NIC can optionally have one or more public IP addresses associated with it.
Load Balancers:

Internal Load Balancers (ILBs): Are assigned a private IP address from the VNet. This serves as the internal endpoint for the load-balanced resources.
Public Load Balancers: Are associated with one or more public IP addresses (the frontend IP). They distribute incoming public traffic to the backend instances (VMs).
Application Gateways:

Are deployed into a subnet and have a private IP address within that subnet.
Can also be associated with one or more public IP addresses for accepting internet traffic.
Private Endpoints:

Use a private IP address from your VNet to connect privately and securely to Azure services. This brings the service directly into your VNet.
IV. Azure Virtual Network Address Ranges:

When creating a VNet, you specify one or more private IP address ranges. Microsoft recommends using the ranges defined in RFC 1918 (10.0.0.0/8, 172.16.0.0/12, 192.168.0.0/16) or the shared address space in RFC 6598 (100.64.0.0/10).
You cannot add the following ranges: 224.0.0.0/4 (multicast), 255.255.255.255/32 (broadcast), 127.0.0.0/8 (loopback), 169.254.0.0/16 (link-local), and 168.63.129.16/32 (internal DNS).
V. Subnet IP Address Ranges:

Subnets are created within a VNet and are assigned a portion of the VNet's address space.
Subnet address ranges must be contiguous and not overlap with other subnets within the same VNet.
Azure reserves five IP addresses within each subnet for its internal use.
VI. Limits:

Azure has limits on the number of public and private IP addresses you can use per subscription and per network interface. These limits vary based on the offer type. You can find detailed limits in the Azure documentation.
For example, by default, there's a limit on the number of public IP addresses per subscription. Contact support to increase these limits if needed.
VII. Managing IP Addresses:

You can manage IP addresses in Azure using:

Azure Portal: A graphical user interface for creating, viewing, modifying, associating, and disassociating IP addresses.
Azure CLI: Command-line tool for managing Azure resources, including IP addresses. Use commands under az network public-ip and az network nic ip-config.
Azure PowerShell: PowerShell cmdlets for managing Azure resources. Use cmdlets like Get-AzPublicIpAddress, New-AzPublicIpAddress, Set-AzNetworkInterfaceIpConfig.
ARM Templates/Bicep: Infrastructure-as-Code tools to define and deploy IP address configurations.
